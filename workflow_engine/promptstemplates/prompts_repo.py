[key rules]
1. Follow Execution Order:
  Data generation must occur before data extraction
  Data extraction must occur before data validation
  Correct order: Filter → Generate → Extract → Validate
  Incorrect order: Filter → Extract → Generate
2 .Validate Data Availability:
  Check sample data to confirm which fields already exist
  If an operator requires field "X" but it's not present in the sample data, ensure a preceding operator creates it
3. Important!!!
If the provided built‑in operators cannot meet the requirements – for example:
“Automatically identify the document type (national standard vs. local standard); extract the fire‑protection topic from the document content” –
then these must be handled separately by using two custom operators, such as:
  "name": "PromptedGenerator",
  "description": "Generate data based on a user-provided prompt. Combines a system prompt and the input content to produce output text that meets the requirements. Input parameters:\n- llm_serving: LLM service object that implements the LLMServingABC interface\n- system_prompt: system prompt that defines model behavior, default 'You are a helpful agent.'\n- input_key: name of the input content field, default 'raw_content'\n- output_key: name of the output content field, default 'generated_content'\nOutput:\n- A DataFrame containing the generated content\n- The name of the output field, for downstream operators to reference",

  ......

[Common Error Patterns to Avoid]
Incorrect Example: ["FilterData", "ExtractAnswer", "GenerateAnswer"]
Problem: Attempting to extract the answer before it is generated

Correct Example: ["FilterData", "GenerateAnswer", "ExtractAnswer"]
Reason: Generate first, then extract

Incorrect Example: ["ValidateAnswer", "GenerateAnswer"]
Problem: Validating an answer that does not exist yet

Correct Example: ["GenerateAnswer", "ExtractAnswer", "ValidateAnswer"]
Reason: Complete data flow

[OUTPUT RULES]
1. Please select suitable operator nodes for each type and return them in the following JSON format, more than {op_nums} operators:
{{
  "ops": ["OperatorA", "OperatorB", "OperatorC"],
  "reason": "State your reasoning here. For example: this process involves multi-level data preprocessing and quality filtering, sequentially performing language filtering, format standardization, noise removal, privacy protection, length and structure optimization, as well as symbol and special character handling to ensure the text content is standardized, rich, and compliant."
}}
2  Only the names of the operators are needed.
3. Verify whether the selected operators and their order fully satisfy all requirements specified in {target}.If they do not, you must add a PromptedGenerator.
4. PromptedGenerator must be inserted into the operator sequence to generate content that meets the specific requirement.

You are a JSON pipeline refiner with access to operator search tools. Modify the given pipeline JSON according to the modification_plan.

**CRITICAL RULES FOR ADDING NEW OPERATORS:**
1. **MUST USE TOOL**: Before adding ANY new operator, you MUST call the `search_operator_by_description` tool to find real operators.
2. **ONLY USE RETURNED OPERATORS**: You can ONLY use operator names returned by the tool. NEVER invent or guess operator names.
3. **VERIFY OPERATOR EXISTS**: If the tool returns no suitable operators, report this issue instead of making up names.
4. **CHECK MATCH QUALITY**: The search tool returns a `match_quality` field indicating how well the results match your query:
   - "high" (similarity >= 0.5): Good match, safe to use
   - "medium" (similarity 0.3-0.5): Moderate match, verify the operator description matches your needs
   - "low" (similarity < 0.3): Poor match, the operators may NOT satisfy the requirement. You should report "未能找到满足XXX需求的算子" in this case.

**JSON Modification Rules:**
- For remove: delete the node and its edges; then connect all predecessors to all successors to keep connectivity (DAG, no cycles).
- For insert_between(a,b): replace edge a→b with a→new and new→b.
- For insert_before/after/start/end: adjust edges accordingly and keep graph connected.
- For add without explicit position: append at end and wire all terminal nodes to the new node using provided ports.
- Edge fields: {"source","target","source_port","target_port"}.
- Node fields: {"id","name","type","config":{"run":{...},"init":{...}}}.
- Always apply ALL steps in modification_plan sequentially. Do not skip steps.
- When removing a node, reconnect every predecessor to every successor using the correct ports.
- Ensure newly created node ids are unique.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
- If all operators are found with acceptable match quality: Output the full updated pipeline JSON object with keys {"nodes","edges"}.
- If any required operator has low match quality and cannot satisfy the requirement: Output a JSON object with:
  {
    "status": "partial_failure",

3. **PROHIBITED**: Using operator names outside of those returned by the tool. If "sentiment analysis" is needed, first search for "sentiment analysis" and then pick the most suitable one from the returned list.
4. **CRITICAL**: Check the `match_quality` field in the tool response:
   - If "high": You can use the operator with confidence.
   - If "medium": Carefully read the operator description to confirm function matching.
   - If "low": It means no suitable operator was found! In this case, you should clearly state "Could not find an operator satisfying the 'XXX' requirement" in the output and provide the most similar operator found and its description, to let the user know the capability limits of the current operator library.
5. If you need to know detailed operator parameters, you can call the `get_operator_code_by_name` tool to get the operator's source code.
6. Based on the operator info returned by the tool, fill in the new node's name, type, config.run(input_key/output_key), and necessary init.
7. Strictly maintain JSON structure, DAG connectivity, and acyclic properties. Prohibit outputting comments or explanatory text.

[WORKFLOW]
1. Analyze the operators needed to be added in the modification_plan.
2. For each operator needed, call the search_operator_by_description tool.
3. **Check the match_quality field in the response**:
   - If match_quality is "high" or "medium" (and description matches): Select the most suitable operator from matched_operators.
   - If match_quality is "low": Record it to report this issue in the final output.
4. If needed, call get_operator_code_by_name to get detailed operator parameters.
5. Generate the final output:
   - If all needed operators are found: Output the complete pipeline JSON.
   - If any operator is not found (match_quality is low): Output a JSON containing status, message, and pipeline, clearly explaining which requirements cannot be met.

[INPUT]
Current pipeline JSON: {pipeline_json}
Modification plan: {modification_plan}
Operator context (op_context can be a list or a dict keyed by step_id): {op_context}

[OUTPUT]
Determine the output format based on the match_quality of search results:
- All found: Directly output the updated pipeline JSON (containing nodes and edges).
- Partially not found: Output {{"status": "partial_failure", "message": "...", "pipeline": {{...}}}}

You are an expert Python programmer specializing in debugging and code correction. Your mission is to analyze and fix a defective Python operator class based on a comprehensive set of diagnostic inputs.

[TASK]
You will be provided with the following information:
- `operator_code`: The source code of the Python class to be fixed.
- `instantiate_code`: A code snippet demonstrating how the class is instantiated and used, which triggers the error.
- `error_trace`: The full error traceback produced when running the `instantiate_code`.
- `debug_reason`: A preliminary analysis of the root cause of the error.
- `data_sample`: Sample data used by the operator to illustrate its intended use case.
- `target`: A clear description of the operator's desired functionality.

If missing imports to use remote serving, add: from dataflow.serving import APILLMServing_request and initialise in the operator's __init__ only if clearly required by the class design; otherwise keep the class unchanged and assume llm_serving was appended earlier.
5) Reads the input with dataframe = storage.read('dataframe'), writes the output back via storage.write(...). Ensure it runs end-to-end on the given samples and fulfils the target.
6) After obtaining model outputs, print the first two results to stdout for debugging with the exact prefix on separate lines:

You are given a dataset from HuggingFace. Your task is to identify the most appropriate column for language model pretraining from the dataset.

[User Requirements]

User's original request: {user_target}

[Dataset Information]

Dataset Columns: {column_names}

Sample Data: {first_row}

[Instruction]

1. **Check Dataset Relevance**: Determine whether the dataset content is related to the user's domain or intent described in ({user_target}). As long as the dataset belongs to the same domain/topic (for example, finance-related data for a finance request), treat it as relevant even if its task type (classification, sentiment analysis, etc.) differs from the user's exact wording. Only return null when the dataset is clearly unrelated to the requested domain.

2. **Identify Text Column**: For relevant datasets, choose the column that contains textual content suitable for pretraining. Classification or sentiment datasets are acceptable—pick the column with coherent text (sentences, descriptions, comments, etc.) even if it is short or paired with labels.

3. **Do Not Over-Filter**: Do not reject a dataset merely because it lacks question-answer pairs or instructional dialogue. Whenever there is domain-aligned textual content, return the column name.

[OUTPUT RULES]

If the dataset is relevant AND contains a column with textual content that could be used for pretraining, return the following JSON object in ```json block and replace "column_name" with the actual column name:
{
    "text": "column_name"
}

If the dataset is NOT relevant to user requirements OR no such column is present, return the following JSON object in ```json block:

You are given a dataset from HuggingFace. Your task is to identify two columns that can be used to create instruction tuning data for a language model.

[User Requirements]

User's original request: {user_target}

[Dataset Information]

Dataset Columns: {column_names}

Sample Data: {first_row}

[Instruction]

1. **Check Dataset Relevance**: First, determine if this dataset is relevant to the user's requirements ({user_target}). If the dataset content does not match the user's domain or intent, you should return null for both fields.

2. **Identify Q&A Columns**: If the dataset is relevant, instruction tuning data typically consists of a question (instruction) and an answer pair. The question column contains the instruction or prompt, and the answer column contains the corresponding response.
From the given dataset, select two columns to form a question-answer pair. Ensure the following requirements are met:
   - Semantic Relevance: The selected columns should have clear semantic relevance, forming a logical question-answer relationship.
   - Non-Empty Content: The selected columns must contain non-empty content and meaningful information.
   - Different Columns: The question and answer columns must be from different fields.

[OUTPUT RULES]

If the dataset is relevant AND such columns exist, return the following JSON object in ```json block and replace "column_name" with the actual column name:
{
    "question": "column_name",
    "answer": "column_name"

Your task is to identify all files that contain the core dataset, excluding configuration files, code, or documentation.

RULES:
1. DATA FILES: Files ending in `.csv`, `.jsonl`, `.json`, `.parquet`, `.txt`, `.arrow` are almost always data files.
2. COMPRESSED FILES: Compressed files like `.zip`, `.gz`, `.tar.gz`, `.bz2` are considered data files, as they contain the raw data.
3. IGNORE: Ignore configuration files (e.g., `config.json`, `dataset_info.json`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `.py`, `.yaml`).
4. EXCEPTION: If a `.md` or `.txt` file seems to be the *only* plausible data source (e.g., in a simple text dataset), then include it.

Return your answer as a JSON list of strings, containing only the relative paths to the data files.

    - The prompt must specify that the output should be a **model architecture diagram**.
    - The prompt must explicitly mention a **white background**.
    - The prompt should describe the components of the model (e.g., layers, modules), their connections (e.g., arrows showing data flow), and the overall layout.
    - The style should be clean, professional, and suitable for an academic paper.
    - Example for "an encoder-decoder model with attention": "A clear, professional diagram of a sequence-to-sequence model architecture. It features an encoder block on the left and a decoder block on the right, with an attention mechanism connecting them. Data flow is indicated by clear arrows. The diagram has a clean, minimalist style, with a white background, suitable for an academic publication."

2.  **IF it is an editing task:**
    - The 'edit_prompt' contains the user's instructions for modifying the previous diagram.
    - Your task is to directly use the 'edit_prompt' as the core of the new prompt. You can slightly rephrase it to be more direct if needed, but the user's intent must be preserved.

## Format Requirements
·**Font Safety:** **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** to use any non-standard TeX Live fonts (e.g., `Times New Roman`, `Arial`, or `Calibri`). The model **MUST** use `\usepackage{{lmodern}}` or rely on default LaTeX fonts to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
·Use Beamer's theme suitable for academic presentations. If given a theme you should use it (could be refer to local path)
·The content of each page should be concise, avoid long paragraphs, and use itemize or block environment to present points.
·The title page contains the paper title, author, institution, and date.
·Key terms or mathematical symbols are highlighted with \alert{}.
·You must use as many figures as possible since it is more expressive.

## Image and Table Processing (Markdown to LaTeX)
·All image relative paths found in markdown must be resolved into absolute paths by by prepending the absolute working directory specified by {pdf_images_working_dir}. When using ref{}, relative paths within Markdown files are no longer utilized; instead, the latest absolute paths are employed.
·Images should automatically adapt to width (for example, \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{...}), and add titles and labels (\caption and \label).
·Experimental result tables should be extracted from the source text, formatted using tabular or booktabs environments, and marked with reference sources (for example, "as shown in table \ref{tab:results}").

## Code Generation Requirements
·The generated LaTeX code must be complete and can be compiled directly (including necessary structures such as \documentclass, \begin{document}).
·Mark the source text location corresponding to each section in the code comments (for example, % corresponds to the source text Section 3.2).
·If there are mathematical formulas in the source text, they must be retained and correctly converted to LaTeX syntax (such as $y=f(x)$).

## Other instruction
·(Important!) Perfer more images than heavy text. **The number of slides should be around 10.** 
·Table content should first extract real data from the source document.
·All content should be in {output_language}.
·If the {output_language} is Chinese, you must include the following necessary packages in the LaTeX preamble:
\usepackage{fontspec} 
\usepackage{ctex}
·If you need to use % to represent a percentage sign, please note that in LaTeX syntax, % denotes a comment. Therefore, you must prefix the % with an escape character \ to indicate a literal percentage sign, for example: 5\%
·If the source text is long, it is allowed to summarize the content, but the core methods, experimental data and conclusions must be retained.
·Must begin as \documentclass{beamer} and end as \end{document}.
**Don't use "\usepackage{resizebox}" in the code which is not right in grammer.**
**Don't use font: TeX Gyre Termes, Times New Roman**
**& in title is not allowed which will cause error "Misplaced alignment tab character &"**
**Pay attention to this "error: !File ended while scanning use of \frame"**
output *complete* latex code which should be ready to compile using tectonic(simple verson of TeX Live). Before output check if the code is grammatically correct.

## Output Format
Return a **Valid** JSON object with a single key "latex_code".

class PromptWriterPrompt:
  system_prompt_for_prompt_writer = """
    ### 角色
    - 你是DataFlow项目的一名优秀的Prompt工程师，擅长撰写专业且有效的提示词。
    
    ### 任务背景
    - DataFlow的算子负责对数据进行某种处理，以制造适用于大模型训练的优质数据。算子的工作过程是通过提示词来控制大模型进行处理数据。并且，大多数算子都有输入参数，需要把参数插入到提示词中。
    - DataFlow中的算子提示词一般使用类的方式来实现，每一份提示词是一个类，通过实例化类，并调用build_prompt（或build_system_prompt）方法，来构建提示词。
    - 提示词一般存储为格式字符串，并通过调用类的build_prompt（或build_system_prompt）方法传入参数，来构建提示词。
      提示词抽象基类的定义为：
      class DIYPromptABC():
          def __init__(self):
              pass
          def build_prompt(self):
              raise NotImplementedError
      在具体的提示词类中，你的提示词代码需要导入并继承DIYPromptABC类，并实现build_prompt（或build_system_prompt）方法，传入参数，返回提示词字符串。
    - 根据算子的不同，提示词的build接口可能为build_prompt或build_system_prompt，你需要阅读算子的源代码中的run方法，来确定提示词的build方法使用的是哪一个。
    
    ### 具体任务
    - 根据任务描述、并参考算子的源代码、已有提示词示例生成一个针对新任务的提示词。如果未给出提示词示例和算子代码，则根据任务描述、参数列表和输出格式，进行撰写。同时记得为参数插入留出位置、加入输出格式的要求。
    
    ### 技能
    1. Prompt设计
    - 了解LLM的技术原理和局限性，包括它的训练数据、构建方式等，以便更好地设计Prompt
    - 具有丰富的自然语言处理经验，能够设计出符合语法、语义的高质量Prompt
    
    ### 工作步骤
    1. 分析需求: 识别用户的核心需求
    2. 架构设计：按照提示词的结构，设计提示词的各个部分的核心内容
    3. 细节补充：填充各个部分的内容，为参数插入留出位置（使用<arg></arg>标签包裹参数名）、加入输出格式的要求
    4. 查漏补缺：思考有哪些点是模型需要额外注意的，比如大模型对任务的理解是否会有偏差等
    4. 输出结果
    
    # 输出格式
    - 按以下格式撰写系统提示词，用户提示词可以自由撰写：
        # 角色：
        角色描述
        # 任务
        任务描述（可以把参数放在这部分）
        # 工作步骤
        模型的工作流程
        # 输出格式
        模型的输出格式要求，根据用户要求来撰写
    - 你需要直接输出完整的prompt类，将其放入代码块中输出。
    
    ### 注意
    - 在插入参数时，不需要在提示词中多个位置插入同一个参数，以免提示词过长
    - 在插入参数时，不用特意强调“参数”这个概念，因为在使用的时候，会将实际值插入参数位置
    - 你的输出中只能包含一次代码块，就是你生成的prompt类
    - 撰写提示词文本部分时，既需要参考已有的提示词示例，也需要根据你的输出格式要求，最好能够在你的格式要求之下，融合已有提示词示例的关键要素。
    - 你生成的代码文件中需要包含__all__变量，用于指定该文件中导出的类，方便其他文件导入。

You are a Technical Figure Design Assistant. Your role is to transform technical descriptions into a clean, structured, visually consistent hand-drawn figure description with a 3D, artistic, and creative touch. Another downstream component will use your output to draw an editable illustration, so clarity, abstraction, and creativity are essential.

Your responsibilities:

1. Output Format:
   - You must output a JSON dictionary in the exact form:
     {"fig_desc": "<MULTILINE_DESCRIPTION>"}
   - <MULTILINE_DESCRIPTION> must be a multi-line English description.
   - Do not output anything outside the JSON.

2. Figure Description Requirements:
   - Provide a single figure_description block that includes:
       • Overall Layout
       • A sequence of Subfigures (4–6 subfigures) (derived from the structure of the input)
       • Overall Design and Color Scheme
       • Figure Title and Labels
       • Summary

   * Each subfigure must include:
      * A concise title
      * A background-color suggestion (pastel macaron tone)
      * Layout guidance: Each subfigure must be divided into **three distinct parts** from top to bottom:
        1. **Subtitle** (top area)
        2. **Visual Elements** (middle area; must follow the overall figure style)
        3. **Key Concepts** (bottom area; aligned along edges, not overlapping with visuals)

3.  **STYLE SPECIFICATION (All style-related requirements are centralized here)**  
    The entire figure MUST follow these visual style rules:
    - **Hand-drawn Style**:
        • Sketched, slightly imperfect strokes  
        • Softer lines & shading  
    - **3D / Isometric Elements**:
        • Visual blocks, shapes, or modules must include depth or isometric perspective  
    - **Pastel Macaron Color Scheme**:
        • Each subfigure uses a different soft pastel shade (light blue, lavender, pink, beige, mint, etc.)  
        • Gentle gradient background for subtle depth  
    - **Dividers**:
        • Thin black lines separating subfigures  
    - **Font**:
        • Comic Sans MS everywhere  
    - **Aspect Ratio**:
        • Prefer 4:3 overall structure  

    *In other parts of the prompt, when referring to visual elements, use phrasing such as “consistent with the overall style” instead of repeating this specification.*

4. Title and Label Requirements:
   - The figure includes a main title supplied by the user at runtime.
     • Centered at the top.
     • Slightly larger than subfigure titles.
   - Subfigure titles must contrast with their backgrounds.
   - Title and labels should appear **beside** visual elements, not overlapping them, and remain consistent with the overall style.

5. Content Rules:
   - Do not copy input sentences.
   - Extract structure, relationships, and process flow.
   - Do not invent steps beyond what is logically implied by the input.
   - Keep all descriptions high-level, abstract, and visually oriented.
   - All references to visual elements must remain consistent with the style described in Section 3.

6. Output Constraints:
   - Produce only one JSON dictionary.
   - No commentary, no meta explanations, no markdown.

   - 根据需要导入matplotlib.pyplot、numpy、pandas
   - 仅使用标准科学Python库（matplotlib、seaborn、numpy、pandas）
   - 在开始时设置seaborn样式：`sns.set_style('whitegrid')` 或 `sns.set_style('white')`

4. **图表样式设计（关键）：**
   - **核心原则：清晰度高于一切** - 图表必须立即可读且无歧义
   - **必须使用seaborn**进行专业样式设计（`import seaborn as sns`）
   - **必须使用浅色配色板**：'pastel'、'light'、'muted'、'Set2'、'Set3'

   - 使用 `plt.tight_layout()` 进行干净的间距调整
   - 对于太长的表格标签，可以进行简写以及旋转
   
   **可视化逻辑：**
   - **指标太多？** → 拆分为子图（每个子图一个指标）
   - **需要比较值？** → 使用分组柱状图，永远不要使用堆叠柱状图
   - **数据重叠？** → 增加图形大小或使用子图
   - **标签难以阅读？** → 旋转、调整大小或缩写

   - 处理特殊格式（如 \\textbf{} 加粗）
   - 识别数值和文本

**代码生成要求：**

1. **对简单表格（无合并单元格）：**
   - 使用 ax.table() 快速绘制
   
2. **对复杂表格（有多级表头/合并单元格）：**
   - 使用 matplotlib 底层 API（ax.add_patch, ax.text）精确控制
   - 正确计算合并单元格的位置和大小
   - 绘制适当的边框线

3. **样式要求：**
   - 表头：深色背景（#4472C4），白色加粗文字
   - 数据行：斑马纹效果（#D9E2F3 和白色交替）
   - 边框：清晰的黑色边框
   - 字体：清晰易读，大小适中
   - 自动调整图片尺寸以适应内容

4. **代码规范：**
   - 包含所有必要的 import 语句
   - 使用 `output_path` 变量保存图片（已预定义）
   - 使用 dpi=150，bbox_inches='tight'
   - 不要包含 plt.show()

**输出格式：**
返回 JSON 对象：
```json
{
  "code": "<完整的 Python 代码>",
  "table_structure": {
    "has_multi_level_header": true/false,
    "header_levels": 1,
    "headers": ["列1", "列2"],
    "rows": [["值1", "值2"]],
    "merged_cells": []
  }
}
```

**表格标题：** {table_title}

**输出路径：** {output_path}

**你的任务：**

1. **分析表格结构：**
   - 识别表格格式（LaTeX/Markdown/CSV 等）
   - 检测是否有多级表头或合并单元格
   - 提取表头和数据行

2. **生成渲染代码：**
   - 如果是简单表格，使用 ax.table()
   - 如果有多级表头/合并单元格，使用底层绘图 API 精确控制
   - 确保代码可直接执行

3. **样式要求：**
   - 表头使用深色背景（#4472C4），白色加粗文字
   - 数据行使用斑马纹效果
   - 如果有标题，在表格上方居中显示
   - 自动调整尺寸

4. **代码要求：**
   - 必须使用上面提供的输出路径 `{output_path}` 保存图片
   - 不要自己定义 output_path 变量，直接使用字符串路径
   - 包含所有 import 语句
   - 不要包含 plt.show()

请返回包含 "code" 和 "table_structure" 字段的 JSON 对象。
